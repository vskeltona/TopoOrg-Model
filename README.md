TopoOrg_Model notebook contains the main model and a brief explanation
of the objective of the project. Skin_Patch_V2 file generates the data
the model is trained with and TopoOrg_Analysis is a supplementary file 
showing the major atributes of the model in more detail.
The two .csv files are sample data that can be used to run the parts of
the code where the model should be already trained. The file names are
already specified in the code and do not need to modified
